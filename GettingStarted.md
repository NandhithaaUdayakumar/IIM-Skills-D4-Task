# How to set up WhatsApp Web and use the messaging platform from your computer
### Most people are familiar with using WhatsApp via a mobile app on their phone, but not everyone is aware that it's also possible to use WhatsApp on the computer desktop â€” either in a web browser or using a desktop app. The main difference?

- You can also use WhatsApp from your computer by installing the *WhatsApp desktop* application.
- You can open *multiple WhatsApp accounts* on your computer as long as you use a different browser window for each one.

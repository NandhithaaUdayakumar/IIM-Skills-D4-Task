### Most people are familiar with using WhatsApp via a mobile app on their phone, but not everyone is aware that it's also possible to use WhatsApp on the computer desktop â€” either in a web browser or using a desktop app. The main difference? You still need to log into WhatsApp on the computer using your WhatsApp mobile app.

## How to access WhatsApp Web or the desktop app
There are two ways to access your WhatsApp account on your PC or Mac computer:
- [x] Use the web app. Go to <a href="https://web.whatsapp.com" target="_blank">whatsapp web</a> in a web browser.
  1. Once you've opened the webpage or installed and run the desktop app, you should see a **QR code** on your computer.
  2. Start **WhatsApp on your phone**.
  3. Tap **Settings**. On *iPhone*, you'll find **Settings** at the bottom right of the screen, but on *Android* tap the **three-dot menu** at the top right and then choose **Settings** in the drop-down menu.


- [ ] Use the desktop app. Install the WhatsApp desktop app on your Mac or Windows computer from the WhatsApp download page.
